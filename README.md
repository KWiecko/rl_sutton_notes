# Reinforcement Learning course notes and clarifications

## Course's link:

## Rationale

Although extensive notes available (pelase take look at the 'Sources' section) none of them are available as markdowns which makes them hard to edit / change. Since we have recently started RL courses we wanted to make our own notes. However it seemed pointless to do it all over again hence copy-paste startign point from existing materials. 

## Currently all of the materials are copied from 2 sources:

 - ### [Abhilasha Saroj's Medium's articles (week 1 - 4)](https://medium.com/@abhilashasaroj.genuine/fundamentals-of-reinforcement-learning-cousera-course-notes-week-1-9baf7eeebdfe)

 - ### [Seungkyu Lee's Medium's articles (week 1 - 4)](https://medium.com/@seungklee90/personal-notes-fundamentals-of-reinforcement-learning-week-3-e1f4660d1261)
